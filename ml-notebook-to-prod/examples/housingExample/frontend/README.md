# House pricing predictor frontend

This is a small frontend to demonstrate a simple site that predicts the sell
value of a house based on user entered features.

# Usage
## Install, compile and run:
Run in a virtualenv:

```bash
$ pip install nodeenv
$ nodeenv -p
$ node_modules/yarn/bin/yarn yarn install
$ node_modules/yarn/bin/yarn run watch
```

You'll need to have the housepriceapi running locally for predictions to work!
